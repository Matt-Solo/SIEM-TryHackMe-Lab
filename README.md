# SIEM-TryHackMe-Lab
The “Introduction to SIEM” lab on TryHackMe provided me with hands-on experience using Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools within a simulated enterprise environment.

---

## 🔑 Key Skills & Lessons Learned
- ✅ Gained foundational knowledge of **SIEM tools and architecture**
- ✅ Analyzed real-world security events using **Splunk**
- ✅ Investigated suspicious logins and brute-force activity using **event IDs**
- ✅ Practiced writing **SPL (Search Processing Language)** queries
- ✅ Understood how SIEMs help in **threat detection and incident response**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Splunk**
- **Windows Event Logs**
- **TryHackMe virtual SOC lab**

---

## 🧭 Lab Walkthrough (Steps Taken)
1. ✅ Launched a virtual SOC environment with Splunk installed
2. 📥 Collected and explored Windows Security Event Logs
3. 🔍 Searched for **Event ID 4625** (failed logins) and **4688** (process creation)
4. 🧠 Analyzed user login patterns and identified brute-force attempts
5. 🧩 Correlated events using SPL to detect suspicious activity across multiple sources
6. 📊 Created basic visualizations and dashboards in Splunk
7. 📝 Answered guided incident response questions to simulate a real SOC workflow

---

## 🔍 Investigation Highlights
- Correlated log sources to detect **account lockouts** from brute-force attempts
- Queried and filtered logs to identify **suspicious process executions**
- Detected **failed logins**, unusual access times, and mapped potential **malicious activity**

---

## 🎯 Why This Lab Matters
This lab simulated the real-world responsibilities of a **SOC analyst** and sharpened my ability to:
- Think critically while analyzing logs
- Connect event data to potential security incidents
- Use a SIEM platform effectively in an investigation workflow

It was a solid step toward becoming a *job-ready SOC analyst*, equipped with practical, hands-on skills.
